# ToadList
NodeJS-based visually appealing Firebase Todo list implementation using the Material Design UX approach<br/>
<i><b>Note:</b> This app is still under development.</i>

## To setup:
Go to the main directory and type `npm install`

## To run:
Go to the main directory and type `npm start` or `node server.js`<br/>
The app can now be found at `localhost:7000`<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note: to gain access to the system you are required to register an account</i>

## Behind the app:
The app was originally made because I have been wanting to create a web app using Firebase for some time now and I thought that the event-driven nature of a Todo List application would be a good fit.<br/>
<br/>
For more information regarding why I chose to go with NodeJS spesifically, see <a href = "https://stackoverflow.com/a/5062670" target = "_blank">this</a> StackOverflow post. In summarry, the app will require multiple concurrent connections and this is where NodeJS is especially powerful since "the server has no need of maintaining separate threads for each open connection".
